Free of Debts
==============

| This is the way you become free of debts 
| You will be found in the connexion p implies p
| And has no more than three 
| 
| Suggest to your mind some such possibility as this
| That every proposition alters something in common 
| Between a fact 
| And an Infinite Space 
| 
| When you rise above your personality, 
| A Being above your personality, 
| A Being which is of great importance
| The use of the Universal Mind 
| Is the explanation of the object itself 
| 
| The Universal Mind is the totality of propositions 
| And is based upon the Elements 
| 
| Given the composition of facts 
| To which objects are colourless
| Two objects of the objects
| Roughly speaking
| The groups of truth-conditions 
| Are equal numbers of white and black
| 
| But to them that they are identical is nonsense
| And to all the general form is the sign
| 
| Essential are those which alone and independently have a threefold  manifestation
| Three functions attributes or characteristics
| This and that and one
| Essential and subtle 
| Law and Love
| 
| If you want to visit the Atomic Plane
| Esoteric meaning is always more or less vague 
| So every proposition is the same
| 
| But the possibility of every truth-operation on the mind and the proof 
| Must show that there are places for arguments 
| Of the probability Trs to Tr 
| 
| So the measure of the human organism is your Being
| That is all 
| 
| But you may perceive some activity in the innermost depths 
| Ghosts of earthbound spirits
| No proposition can contradict it
| 
| Identity in the world is also given
| This last is a Path that attempts to rediscover 
| The symbol for the other 
| 
| Do not be disturbed by apparent irregularities 
| Do not be disturbed by the marks of triangles and hexagons together
| A particle cannot at its root mean the same as (âˆƒx).fx 
| The determination is a sign
| 
| Essential are those who find true peace 
| And quiet and strength 
| And renewal within the Causal Worlds 
| 
| And whether found ascending in the East 
| Or descending in the West 
| The plane is without stress
