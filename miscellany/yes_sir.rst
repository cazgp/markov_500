Yes Sir
=========

| We are in the beginning of a lull
| And I have had an emotional experience
| Yes sir! 
| 
| Very calmly and very quietly I say 
| All right 
| Look at Gunsmoke  
| Look at the proletariat 
| The anarchy in production 
| The crying inequalities in the modes of producing and appropriating products,
| That is bound to have an answer
| Get a Bible
| Get others
| Get the money
| 
| That is the bourgeoisie
| Use their life
| Take their time and labor 
| They smash to pieces machinery
| They set factories ablaze
| They seek to alter the character of production
| 
| Therefore, as the people who profess one thing 
| One social thing
| We go 
| Because we take the name of God at the foot of the old property relations 
| Not justified by faith 
| But cooking with gas now 
| 
| I say, that's great
| I say, that's great 
| I say, Lady, if it's carried out in your place
| 
| Dissolution going on before our television sets
| Spending our time filling the night before 
| I saw an inscription coming up this mountain 
| To the unknown God 
| Do You believe in Christ?
| Have you really given yourself to Christ? 
| Do You believe in Him?
| You must obey Christ
| I can do! 
| See Romans 7:18-20 
| 
| And the heroes of modern American life?
| We take His name 
| We write it down 
| The Manifesto has become fully developed
| A new life of the state of society 
| Minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements
| 
| And how does it direct the young people? 
| Learn more by watching than by reading
| Why do you know what living was?
| I follow God and that place where the workers begin to form combinations
| Trades' Unions 
| Against the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a nuclear war 
| 
| That could be a revolution
| On the floor of the Law
| But administrative reforms based on class antagonisms 
| Shall no flesh be justified
| Justification is a God of love 
| For God so loved the world 
| So we try to commit suicide 
| With a Texas millionaire with a long face 
| We need guidance
