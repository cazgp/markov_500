Course to the Pond
===================

| As if the sun was withdrawing 
| In the last book of an evening 
| With a few feet distant 
| As if laboring 
| With some remote horizon
| 
| I heard a prudent man found himself 
| Planning and contriving 
| Against his will
| All dark-colored 
| And saturated with dew
| 
| I saw the axe out again
| I heard him express wonder 
| His gnarled rind serving 
| The god of loons
| 
| Snapping the air
| Pressed by a spring fire
| Burst from the point of a belt
| Another year's life 
| Gone and come with a smile
| 
| And the course to the pond
| We should be so idle
| To try all that we are
| At length 
| At any rate
| 
| To cut off the top 
| Of the thick woods south
| To fain turn over
| Unobscured by weeds
|
| To know the hall 
| Know them breaking ground
| Village and trowel
| Fishes and judges 
| Judges and jays
| Wind away
|
| Wind away
