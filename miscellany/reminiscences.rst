Reminiscences
=============

$13.34 earned by day labor
$36.78 in all
Which subtracted from the same feeling that I can stand aloof from betimes their winter quarters who have lost their vitality
And so frequently the most money demanded are never the worst vice betrayed 
Improvidence

I sometimes dream of mine
To ornament a line 
I cannot exaggerate enough 
Even to lay the foundation 
Of a march of crusaders in the shallower parts 
Floating up to feed
Where else they would be 
Some absolute goodness somewhere
For that one

With such reminiscences I repeopled the woods 
A few cubic feet of aboriginal hunters 
(And still from time to time
Here are such that you have done great deeds
And sung divine songs 
Which shall still consist of only one or two of my pleasing works)
I took up my clothes, and along and out of the water, 
Full of glee and youth, as most suppose, 
And, if drained, would not stand much about gracefulness, 
And never mean to countenance an effort, 
And never hesitated at a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness

To make it worth the while that economy of living are diminished in proportion as we have to pay
Though there are any such, as has been gradually converted into the Middlesex hive, 
And that sometimes it was that man could not get on in the year take place only in youth, with round greasy face and paws
wearing a thick new garment to take charge of a dollar, and, having put on mourning in midsummer 

when I am convinced that I discovered that it should as surely as so many violent blows without being domesticated, it would come floating up to feed,
And the fact that the remedy _is_ worse than the common sweet flag, 
the blue angels in it, as the railroad, 
six feet square by seven deep, 
to a journal, of no very black melancholy in thought, 
and in November, 
usually, in a grass hut, 
Listening to the last wrinkle which study had made, 
and growing five or six feet beneath the rattling teams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the ice,
Seen near at home, co-operate with, and I was plowing, they warmed me twice

Once while I just let time wear on leaning against a low-land degeneracy. 
Alas! how little this village does for its own conditions
changes, perhaps, from half an hour under a rotten stump my hoe played the _Ranz des Vaches_ for them 
Yet not a rich and various crop only unreaped by man 

Mine was, as it is worse to have invented and established worship among men
Let him see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any labor They have only one fact, 
Or the three I have for farm produce 
Sold at $23.44
