Every heaven is hung by clouds or sown with stars
==================================================

| Give us time to reflect
| What is life 
| What is the content of our friend or wife 
| Frightened of something
| We become what we utter
| Vehicular and transitive

| All symbols are fluxional
| The mind will find a rational explanation 
| And plunge itself into every partridge, fox, squirrel, and mole
| And in the woods and waters roll
| 
| But what is holistic? 
| What is the soul? 
| What arises from the night?
| What is history but an optical illusion 
| About every person we meet
|
| See 
| The foaming brook 
| Without compunction
| Our problem in the whole movement of thought
| Must inevitably fall in its right place
|
| Wherever are forms with transparent boundaries 
| Wherever are forms with transparent boundaries 
| Wherever are outlets into celestial space 
| Wherever is stillness and awe 
|
| The Caliph Ali is seeking after thee
| Therefore be at rest from seeking after thee 
| Therefore be at rest from seeking after it
