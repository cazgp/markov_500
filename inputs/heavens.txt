￼The Divine Milieu exists all about us, in every realm of the Cosmos
The Divine Milieu
This whole Universe is an Incarnation of God, the Absolute Beingness, of which nought can be said. Within this Incarnation, or Divine Immanence, there are various planes, realms, states or conditions of Being. Jesus referred to the multi-dimensionality of the Universe by these words to His immediate disciples, shortly before His death:
In my Father’s House there are many mansions [realms]... I go to prepare a place for you.
John 14:2
The “Father’s House” spoken of by Jesus was called the Plerøma by the Greek Mystics and the Gnostics (the Knowers). The modern French Mystic, Teilhard de Chardin, called it the Divine Milieu (le Milieu Divin). According to de Chardin, the Universe is a Divine Milieu permeated through and through by the Omnipresence of God. This Divine Milieu is the mysterious Plerøma “in which the substantial One [God] and the created many fuse into the All”.
This modern Roman Catholic Mystic used the word Plerøma as it was used in the Greek Mystery Schools and by the Gnostics. The Plerøma is the Alpha and Omega, the “all in all” of Saint Paul:
It is the same God which worketh, all in all.
1 Corinthians 12:6
According to de Chardin, the Heart of God is a “boundless milieu” which has “multae mansiones”. Nowadays we call these “many man- sions” planes, dimensions, worlds, realms, or conditions of Being.
The Divine Milieu exists all about us in every place, on every plane, in every realm of the Cosmos. The Absolute Being Itself exists in all Its Plenitude (fullness, completeness, abundance) everywhere and at all times, but we perceive only as much of It as our minds, consciousness and senses allow. In all that Immensity, there is only one possible place for each of us at any given moment, in accordance with our consciousness.
Milieu
French: “Environment, setting”, from the Latin medius-locus, “the middle place, the central point, the all-pervasive centre or heart of all”.
Plerøma
Greek: The Divine Fullness. The All-Containing Reality. The Fullness of the All-Mind, the Universal or Divine Mind, in which all things exist. That which contains within
It the seven great Planes of Being and all that is within them. The Fullness of Space. The All in All. The Totality of all things. The Totality of Interspace. The Fullness of Light. The Limitless Dimension. The Manifest and the Unmanifest. Omnirevelation. Omniverse. Equivalent to the Upanißadic P√r≈a (Perfection, Completeness). Perceptions of the One Mind 490
The Seven Great Planes
Within our Solar System there are seven great Planes of Being. These you may conceive of as worlds, vibrational states, conditions of matter or energy, or life-realms where dwell certain forms of beings. In the East, these planes or realms are called Loka.
The Greek philosophers taught similar ideas. Pythagoras taught that Existence (the Cosmos) consists of a series of interpenetrating worlds of different degrees of density, with the higher worlds embrac- ing and penetrating all the lower ones.
The Planes of Being are realms, worlds or conditions of existence. Each plane is associated with:
• Certain densities of matter.
• A state of consciousness.
• Particular senses of perception associated with that consciousness.
• Actions of particular forces.
• Certain beings or entities which inhabit that realm.
• Forms or “bodies” through which entities can interact with the
matter and energies of that realm.
Each of the seven great Planes of Being, the seven dimensions of our Universe, occupies the one Space. The Space is the same, but the dimensions are different, the densities of matter are different, and the consciousness is different in each of the strata of Creation. The matter or substance of each plane interpenetrates the one below it, which is of lower vibration and greater density.
Perceiving the One Space
Science fiction writers often theorize about “parallel universes”, “anti- universes”, “hyperspace”, and so forth, but these ideas are distortions of Truth. There is only one Space, but what is seen of it by the physical eyes is but an infinitesimal part of it. This is no exaggeration. The vibratory frequencies perceived by the five bodily senses are only an infinitesimally small fragment of the total vibratory range of the Universe, Space, or Omni-Revelation.

The Planes of Being are realms, worlds or conditions of existence
Kosmos
Greek: The whole Universe as
an ordered, structured Reality, as opposed to Kaos (unordered). The Divine Mind which gives Order and System to all things. From
the Greek we derive the words cosmos, cosmic, chaos, chaotic, etc.
Chiliokosmos
Greek: Chiliocosm. The All. The Cosmic Order. The multi-layered, multi-dimensional, Universal Reality. Mikrokosmos, Makrokosmos, Chiliokosmos 121
Åkå•a
Sanskrit: Space in its totality as the physical body of God. This does not mean some kind of emptiness in which particles of matter float. Åkå•a does not mean there is “nothing there”. On the contrary, Åkå•a means that all is there—total Fullness. Equivalent to the Greek word Plerøma and another Sanskrit word, P√r≈a.

￼These forty-nine states of matter are called the forty-nine Fires
Planes and Subplanes
Each of the seven great Planes of Being has seven subdivisions or subplanes—seven realms, spheres or vibrational states of increasingly finer matter or energy. Thus, there are a total of forty-nine subplanes, or states of matter, within this level of our Solar System. In the Secret Doctrine, the Primeval Wisdom, these forty-nine states of matter are called the forty-nine Fires.
The forty-nine subplanes of the seven Planes of Being together constitute the Cosmic Physical Body of God, what is called the Cosmic Physical Plane or Cosmic Pråk®t∆. Above this there are six other great Cosmic Planes—the Cosmic Astral Plane, Cosmic Mental Plane, and so on—each of which consists of seven great planes and forty-nine subplanes. Since the totality of Man exists upon the Cosmic Physical Plane, the higher Cosmic Planes are beyond human compre- hension and are not of immediate concern to us until we pass out of human evolution altogether into higher evolutionary states of Being.
The lower four mental subplanes of the Cosmic Physical Plane have forms and shapes (R√pa), while the upper three, the Causal Worlds, are without form (Ar√pa). Above the Causal Worlds, the seven subplanes of Buddhi and the seven subplanes of Nirvå≈a are formless, bodiless conditions, as are the planes beyond.
The visible universe consists of the lowest three subplanes of the lowest of the great planes—the solid, liquid and gaseous conditions of the Physical Plane. Thus, of the forty-nine subplanes of our Uni- verse, our physical senses can perceive only the lowest three! The vast forty-six subplanes above the gross physical world remain completely invisible and inaudible to us. What a sobering fact!
Likewise, we perceive only our gross physical bodies. We don’t even see our etheric-physical bodies or Prå≈a (the life-breath), both of which are still on the Physical Plane. Thus, we think of ourselves as gross bodies only, when in fact we cannot even fully experience the Physical Plane, let alone the Astral Plane or beyond.
At death we depart from the gross physical body and it is possible to live for a while in the etheric-physical body on the etheric realms of the Physical Plane. Then we depart from the etheric-physical body and live in various conditions on the seven levels of the great Astral Plane.
Parabrahman
Sanskrit: The Transcendental Reality, the Unutterable Truth, the Godhead beyond and above the Creator (Brahmå). The Unknowable Absolute, which is limitless and which spreads Itself throughout endless Space.
The Transcendental Godhead 112
Pråk®t∆
Sanskrit: Matter, Nature, Substance. The original primary Substance of the Universe.
The Substance of the All. The Goddess, the Feminine Nature, the First or Original Creation, the Archetype of all existing things. The Cosmic Womb or Mother from which All proceeds. Pråk®t∆ refers also to the Physical Plane, and to all seven Planes of Being (Cosmic Pråk®t∆).

￼The Astral Plane is the world of the dead
The lower three subplanes of the Physical Plane are called the dense or gross physical subplanes, corresponding with the three states of matter that we observe with our physical senses: solids, liquids and gases. The higher four subplanes are called the etheric or etheric-physical dimen- sions. Science is beginning to explore the etheric dimensions, without understanding them as such.
Astral Plane
The Astral Plane is the world of the dead, where people go after they die. In the East it is known as Kåma-Loka, “the realm of desires”. It is the realm of emotion and feelings, of psychic energies and forces, of the subconscious mind. The seven astral subplanes, or seven states of astral matter, correspond with the various heavens, hells and purgatories of the world religions.

COSMIC ‘SOLID’ SUBPLANE OF THE COSMIC PHYSICAL PLANE
Mental Plane
As the name implies, the Mental Plane is a world of mind. The lower four subplanes are the realm of the concrete mind or rational mind, which shapes mental matter into thoughtforms. The higher three subplanes (the Causal Worlds) are formless and correspond with the Higher Mind or Abstract Mind. The Human Soul (J∆va) dwells on the formless levels of the Mental Plane.
Buddhic Plane
The Buddhic Plane has been called the Realm of Unities, the Christ Realm or the Intuitional World. It is a formless Light World charac- terized by Divine Unity, Love and Wisdom. The state of Buddhi is Unitive Consciousness, Transcendental Consciousness or Pure Consciousness, wherein the Mystic experiences Oneness with the Universe and with God.
Nirvå≈ic Plane
The Nirvå≈ic Plane is a World of Exuberant Light. The Sanskrit word Nirvå≈a means “blown out, snuffed out”. It is the condition where the personal ego-sense (the personal “I”) does not exist. One becomes one with the Universal “I AM”, the Bright Self of the Universe.
Paranirvå≈ic Plane
Literally, “the Plane beyond Nirvå≈a”, also called A≈upådaka (the Monadic World). The Paranirvå≈ic Plane is the realm of the Monad, Paramåtman, the “Father in Heaven”, the Universal Divine Spirit in Man.
Mahåparanirvå≈ic Plane
Literally, “the Great Plane beyond Nirvå≈a”, also called Ådi (the First Plane) or Satya (the Realm of Truth). This is the realm of Brahman, the Logos, the Godhead. Any being who experiences this realm has already passed beyond human evolution.

Spiritual Evolution consists of transcending the Physical, Astral and Mental Planes and re-identifying with one’s Soul on the higher levels of the Mental Plane (the Causal Worlds), and hence ascending to the Buddhic and Nirvå≈ic Worlds, and finally the Monadic. It is from thence that we came, many aeons ago, and to this realm we shall return on The Great Day of Be With Us.

￼The Wisemen of India described the other Realities in precise, scientific language
The Universal Cosmology
In the early days of Christianity the church knew about the states of existence, hence the remnants of such ideas as hells, purgatories, heavens and limbo states. But the church has forgotten many things. In the language of the Old and New Testaments there is a shortage of words to describe Spiritual Realities. For instance, the word heaven (or heavens) is used to signify the sky, the starry space above, the after- death worlds, the Kingdom of God, and so on. Unlike the Sanskrit language of India, the language of the Old and New Testaments has no precise words to describe the Spiritual Realities.
The Wisemen of India described the other Realities in precise, scientific language. Using parts of the Eastern model, along with some modern terminology, we can clarify the Judeo-Christian teachings of the after-death and spiritual states, and clear away a lot of confusion that is found in the Old and New Testaments and in Christianity today.

The limbo states are states in the etheric-physical body, on the subtle regions of the Physical Plane. This is the realm of the “ghosts”, the earthbound spirits.
Hell
The hell worlds are the lower regions of what, in modern terminology, is called the Astral Plane of this Earth-planet.
Purgatory
The purgatory states are the middle regions of the Astral World, where ordinary people live after death. These people also I would call “earthbound” because their lives are still a reflection of Physical Plane conditions and habits.
Heaven
The lower heavens are the higher, subtler regions of the Astral World. These regions of the Astral World are more rarefied, artistic, intellec- tual, scientific, creative and religious.

￼God, whose Name cannot be uttered, dwells in inaccessible Light.
Jewish Kabbalah
Ascending the Planes of Consciousness
The Planes of Being are composed of different densities of Spirit/ Matter and different vibrational frequencies. You must remember that all the Planes of Being are real. Each world constitutes its own reality. Though separate realities, the planes interpenetrate each other, the higher absorbing the lower. Thus, while Nirvå≈a is its own Reality, it contains all the lesser realities, the lower planes. Similarly, the Astral Plane, though unique, absorbs also the physical reality.
Reality is perceived differently in the different worlds because Consciousness depends upon the qualities of the world you are con- scious in. The lower (or more material) a realm is, the less Conscious- ness there is in it. In each world there is a greater degree of Freedom and Consciousness than in the world below it.
The greatest limitations we encounter on our Physical Plane. As we climb higher in Evolution, each Plane of Being opens up to us as a field of greater Consciousness. Thus, our experience on the Astral Plane is larger and more conscious than our experience in the Physi- cal World, and so on. The higher we climb in Consciousness (as we become aware of the higher worlds), the closer we come to “God”.
Remember that forms and shapes (R√pa) are to be found only up to the causal subplanes of the Mental Plane. Above that, the realms are formless (Ar√pa), void, in a condition of emptiness. However, this does not mean that there is nothing there! On the contrary, the expression of Life is not limited to form, size, measure and weight; on the higher planes, Life is more full, more radiant, more complete! The sense of time is also different on each level.
The Populated Cosmos
There are hierarchies of sentient beings living on each of the seven great planes of the Cosmic Physical Plane, on all forty-nine subplanes (including the etheric subplanes of the Physical Plane), each with corresponding bodies and states of consciousness. These hierarchies of living entities are pursuing their own evolutionary development. Human evolution on this planet is but one of many simultaneous evolutionary processes.They all occupy the same Space!

￼The only Reality is Eternal Duration
The Sense of Time
Where there is Time (Kåla) there is Space (Åkå•a). The “sense of time” is greatest on the Physical Plane and diminishes as one climbs the planes and their subplanes. As you ascend the spheres, the walls of Time become thinner.
Science has an incorrect understanding of Time. Time is not the fourth dimension. Time does not even exist as a distinct entity. Time simply describes a process. The only Reality is Eternal Duration or Timeless Eternity, within which certain things take place. These certain things may be the evolution of a Universe, the motion of a planet, the life of a human being, or whatever.
Your “sense of time” is merely an awareness of a certain sequence of happenings or events. You can measure time with a clock or an atomic process, or whatever, but that is still some process happening in the Universe. And you can have different time scales, but they are all relative to what sort of movement, motion or evolution you are describing. For instance: a dog does not have the same sense of time as a man; an angel does not have the same sense of time as a man; and a Kosmokrator (Greek: Cosmic Creator, Creator-God) has a very different “sense of time” than we could imagine.
You cannot travel back in Time in a machine, or forward into the future. Time is not a thing, nor a dimension, nor even a quality. It simply does not exist! Ask a flower: “What time is it?”
Some Esoteric Teachings on Time
Time is a relation of the succession of one idea after another. It is the product of the mind’s imagination and is relative to the flow of ideas. Space also is a relation of the coexistence of ideas, and so is a relative activity of the mind.
÷
Time is an illusion produced by the succession of our states of conscious- ness as we travel through Eternal Duration, and it does not exist where no consciousness exists in which the illusion can be produced.
÷
Time is that cycle, greater or lesser, in which some life runs some specific course, in which some particular period begins, continues and ends, in Eternity, and is recognized as Time only when the participating life has reached a certain stage of awareness.
￼The Cosmic Creator-Gods 162 Past, Present and Future 1400 The Law of Cyclic Activity 248
There is Eternal Space, the Cosmic Body of God, in which certain things take place. That is all. You may perceive some activity in the Cosmos, and measure that activity, and say that it took place in Time. You can measure those events by relating them to each other—then you have a “sense of time” in your physical brain. But a higher Being than Man would not perceive the event in such a way at all.
When you are out of your body your sense of time radically changes. On the Astral Plane, before you were born, or during an out-of-body experience or near-death experience, or after you have died, you have a different sense of time. Even in the Astral World it is almost as if you are living in Eternity, and this sense of Eternity increases as you move higher up the ladder of Consciousness and climb the Planes of Being. In deep meditation you lose your sense of Time and Space; you experience a Timeless Dimension and an Infinite Space.
When you rise above your personal consciousness, Time stands still. It ceases to exist, because it never was.
The Fullness of the Void
The Physical Body of God becomes brighter, lighter and more formless as you ascend, plane by plane. That is why God is described as having no form. What you see, the physical universe, is the most dense, solid and structured part of the Body of God. As you ascend the planes the forms become lighter, more fluid, more translucent, until you reach the formless conditions of forces and energies.
°√nyatå refers to all the formless worlds, from the Causal Worlds upwards. These worlds are all °√nyatå—without bodies, shapes, forms, limitations. They are not worlds of nothingness; they are full of Life, Love, Intensity, Glory, without the limitations of forms and bodies.
The Sanskrit words °√nyatå and Nirvå≈a have been much misused and misunderstood by the ignorant, including scholars. °√nyatå they translate as “void, emptiness”, as if nothing was there; and Nirvå≈a they translate as “annihilation”. From this, one gets the impression that Buddhism strives for some sort of vacuity, a blank condition where nothing is and where you cease to be. Nothing could be more wrong!
Nirvå≈a is not nihilism, not “nothingness” in a negative sense, but the very Brightness and Fullness of Life Itself! In Nirvå≈a you are more true and alive than you could ever before conceive. Only your personal ego, your faculty of selfishness and self-centredness, is annihilated.

￼The first subplane of any plane is the atomic matter of that plane
Primordial Atoms
Each plane or world is different from all others because of the differ- ences in density of the primordial atoms (A≈u). The ancient Sanskrit word A≈u (atom) does not mean the same as the modern scientific understanding of the word atom. To the Sages, A≈u meant:
• Tiny, invisible lives (such as an “atom” of modern science, which, to the ancients, is a living, intelligent creature), or creatures so small they are not perceived by physical eyes or instruments.
• Something very minute, or very subtle or ethereal in composition (which, of course, would be invisible to the physical eyes).
• The Original Primordial Homogeneous Substance as a single undivided entity, out of which the manifold Creation evolved.
• God, Divinity, the Original State of all things, the subtlest state of Being.
• Atomic matter. A plane is a state or condition of Pråk®t∆ (matter), and the first subplane of any plane is the highest, subtlest matter (A≈u, atomic matter) of that plane.
• Man. The complete individual Man, as One. The personality, the Soul, the Triune Self and the Monad, as one entity.
Monad a
Greek: The Indivisible One. The Whole, the All, the Complete, the One. The Latin Atom or primordial unit. The ancient classical Sanskrit A≈u. This Monad, Atom, A≈u, can be the little world known by science as the “atom”, or a human being, a planet, a solar system or a galaxy; they are all atoms of various sizes. Even a galaxy is just a gigantic Atom or Monad in Omnispace, in the Plerøma, in the Universal Fullness or Reality. (Remem- ber that Space stretches not only outwards, horizontally, but inwards into the various dimensions, the Planes of Being.)
In relation to Humanity, the Monad is the Divine I AM in each human being, your “Father in Heaven”, the I AM Presence in the innermost depths of the Soul. It is the God-Self in Humanity, the overshadowing of Humanity by the Divine Presence at the highest point of Spirit. The Monad cannot be perceived on the personality level of experience, for “no man has seen the Father at any time” (John 1:18).
Who is ‘I AM’? 1418

A≈u
Sanskrit: Atomic matter. A monad or atom.

￼Love is the Law
The Physical Plane is male in relationship to the Astral Plane, which is female. The Mental Plane is male in relationship to the Buddhic Plane, which is female, and so on. There is a further subdivision of polarities on the Mental Plane (the higher and lower) and on the Physical Plane (the etheric and the gross physical).
The following diagram shows which plane or world behaves in an objective (male) manner, and which behaves in a subjective (female) capacity. The Physical, Mental, Nirvå≈ic and Mahåparanirvå≈ic Planes are objective, radiatory, positive and transmitting in character, whereas the Astral, Buddhic and Paranirvå≈ic Planes are subjective, receptive and reflective in character.
This is one way to understand the Father-Mother principle. The Law of Love is the attraction between the opposite poles of being.
Love is the Law of the Solar System, manifesting on all the planes.

￼The Cosmic Elements are the essential substances of all the forms and objects of Creation
The Cosmic Elements
The five Cosmic Elements—Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Aether—are the essential substances of all the forms and objects of Creation, both visible and invisible. They are both the physical substances and the subtle, invisible substances forming the Astral, Mental and Causal Worlds. Each of the Elements also corresponds to the matter or substance of a plane.
P®thiv∆
The Earth Element. The gross elements throughout the Universal Creation, and also the solid substance of all the matter of the physical universe.
Åp, Åpas
The Water Element. The “watery” substance of the radiant-energy of the astral layers of the Universe and throughout Creation.
Tejas, Taijasa, Agni
The Element of Fire. The Cosmic Fiery Substance of the mental realms of Creation, known as Cosmic Fire.
Våyu
The Element Air, which represents degrees of Light. Åkå•a
Aether. Ether. Space, the All-Light of Reality. (This is an esoteric mean- ing which reveals how the Sages used the word Åkå•a.)
Above this are levels of Light-radiations beyond the imagination of one who has not experienced those planes. For the esoteric Sages there are in fact seven Elements, seven great divisions of Universal Substance, of which the physical universe is only the lowest. Each of the seven great Elements is further subdivided into seven, thus producing the forty-nine subplanes of manifestation of the Cosmic Physical Plane of the Universe.
￼The material worlds include not only this Physical World, but also the subtle Etheric Worlds, the Astral Worlds, and the Mental and Causal Worlds, since they are all formed from different densities or subtleties of matter (Pråk®t∆).
Application 1
Earth is all the solid state matter and substances. Water is all the liquid state matter and substances. Fire is all the fiery state matter and substances. Air is all the gaseous state matter and substances.
All of these constitute the gross or dense aspect of the Physical Plane, the dense physical world.
Ether (Aether) refers to the four grades of etheric substances consti- tuting the etheric portion of the Physical Plane, which is invisible.
Application 2
Earth is all the matter and substances of the fourth etheric subplane. Water is all the matter and substances of the third etheric subplane. Fire is all the matter and substances of the second etheric subplane. Air is all the matter and substances of the first etheric subplane.
These constitute the etheric or subtle aspect of the Physical Plane, the etheric-physical world.
Ether (Aether) refers to the Astral Light, the Primordial Substance of the Astral Plane.
Application 3
Earth is all the matter and grades of substances of the Physical Plane and physical universe.
Water is all the matter and grades of substances of the Astral Plane and astral universe.
Fire is all the matter and grades of substances of the Mental Plane and mental universe.
Air is all the matter and grades of substances of the Buddhic Plane and Buddhic Universe.
Ether (Aether) is all the matter and grades of substances of the Nirvå≈ic Plane and Nirvå≈ic Universe, the Åtmic Plane, Nirvå≈a.
This reveals another esoteric meaning of Åkå•a (Ether). Åkå•a is always the subtlest part of any scheme or system. Thus, Åtman and Nirvå≈a and Åkå•a are the same in this esoteric understanding of the Wise.
Åkå•a is always the subtlest part of any system

Attributes of the Elements
The Sanskrit words for the Elements—Tattva, Bh√ta, Tanmåtra— do not mean the “elements” of modern science, which focuses on the Physical Plane alone (including the etheric-physical dimensions, although scientists are not presently aware of this). The elements of science are simply part of the Bh√r-Loka or physical universe. The Cosmic Elements are the substances or matter composing the various worlds or Planes of Being.
Each Element has a threefold manifestation—three functions, attributes or characteristics:
Tattva
“That-ness”. Its essential or subtle aspect. The Law of it, the inner drive of it, that which is producing it.
Bh√ta
“Substance” or “Matter”. Its manifest aspect, its tangible or form aspect.
Tanmåtra
“The Measure of That”. Its vibration, motion or force aspect.
Thus, each Element is a Law; it is expressed tangibly in a form; and it is a power, force, energy, vibration, motion.

￼Zen originated in India as a method of Tantra
Origins of Zen
Zen is a Japanese word which has roughly the same meaning as the Western term Mysticism. It does not mean mediumship or channel- ling, nor any form of psychism. Zen is not astral stuff, not psychic, not phenomenal. It is the experience of the Buddhic Plane, the Realm of Unity, or (in Christian language) the Mystical States, the Mystical Marriage of the Soul to God, which leads to the Kingdom of God, Nirvå≈a.
Zen originated in India as a method of Tantra, where it was called Dhyåna (or Dhyån), meaning “meditation-contemplation”. In ancient India, Dhyåna was practised by thousands of yog∆÷, sådhu÷, sannyåsin÷ and other “holy” men. Gautama Buddha, born 563 years before the Christ, was said to have practised this kind of meditation, by which he attained Enlightenment.
The famous Bodhidharma, an Indian Buddhist monk and the twentieth Patriarch of Buddhism, travelled to China in the year 520 after the birth of Christ and taught Dhyåna to the Chinese. The Chinese called it Chånna (in short, Chån) because they did not pronounce the Sanskrit properly. Later on, the Chinese Mystics spread it to Japan, Korea and elsewhere. In Japan the word was further mispronounced to Zenna or, in short, Zen.
Nowadays most people think that Zen is Japanese. The methods of Zen were practised in India for thousands of years, however, and when the “new” religion of Buddhism arrived in China, the Zen prac- tices quickly merged into the old Chinese religion of Taoism, which was a native Chinese Mysticism identical with Dhyån or Zen. Thus you have Chinese Zen Buddhism. When the Japanese learned it from the Chinese a few centuries later, they adapted it to Japanese cultural backgrounds. The Zen of Japan is a Japanese adaptation, peculiar to the Japanese temperament and consciousness. But to think that Zen came from Japan is just as erroneous as to think that apples came from California because in California they grow apples!
Buddha
Sanskrit:“One who is filled with Light”. An Enlightened One, an Awakened One. This refers to the awakening on the Nirvå≈ic spheres of Being.
Chån
Chinese: “Meditation”. Derived from Chånna, which was in
turn derived from the Sanskrit Dhyåna. In the Japanese language, Chån became Zen.
Samådhi
Sanskrit: The suspended animation of your ordinary thinking mind. In Samådhi you live by °akti (Divine Energy) and Caitanya (Divine Consciousness) alone.
The State of Inner Purity 497 Samådhi: the Goal of Yoga 574
Zen is described by the Chinese Masters as:
The direct pointing to the Mind, for the perception of the Self-Nature, in order to attain Buddhahood.
This is philosophical talk. In practice it means that you meditate in such a way that you can discover the root of your mind, your mind before thought arises. This will help you discover yourself as you truly are, beyond your mind, ego and personality, which will lead you to the state of Buddhahood, Enlightenment, Union with God, Tran- scendental Consciousness.
Buddhi is Love and Bodhi is Wisdom. This is the dual characteristic of the Intuitional Plane—the plane above the Mental and below the Nirvå≈ic. It is called the Buddhic Plane because it is the plane of Love, Unity, One- ness. Thus, Love and Wisdom go together; in the Enlightened Man they are inseparable.
Buddhi: the Realm of Unities 83
Bodhi
Sanskrit: “Awakening”. Wisdom or Enlightenment. From the Sanskrit Budh,“to awake”.

￼What is Zen?
While many Western intellectuals think that Zen is some kind of clever intellectual game, Zen is not a form of intellectualism or verbalism. Zen is actually quite wordless and beyond the mind; therefore it cannot have anything to do with intellectual smartness. The intellectuals who approach Zen with their verbose minds will never be able to grasp it.
Zen is a special mind-to-mind transmission.
Zen is a transmission of Enlightenment which is not dependent on the holy scriptures or sacred books, nor on any writing, speech, ideas or thoughts.
Zen is the direct experience of the Soul, the real part of Man.
Zen is the discovery of one’s Higher Consciousness, one’s Super-
Essential Nature, one’s Buddhahood.
Man’s Original State is this holy Buddha-Nature, but we do not know this because of our spiritual ignorance. Thus, Zen is a Path that attempts to rediscover Man’s Original Nature. It is a Path of self- discovery, leading to Self-Realization and Union with God.
You can discover the root of your mind, your mind before thought arises

Zolar
A ‘Godless’ Religion?
A difficulty arises for the Westerner when we consider that, in the Indian, Chinese and Japanese forms of Zen Buddhism, the words God and Soul are not mentioned at all! Consequently a Christian might think that Zen Buddhism is some kind of godless religion. And so it appears from many Buddhist teachings and the ideas of Buddhist monks. This, perhaps, is because the Buddhists themselves don’t always understand the teachings of the Buddha.
But it is not so. The words or terms are different, that is true; the Buddha never taught of a personal God, nor of a personal Saviour, nor of a personal Salvation process—concepts so popular in the Christian West. The Buddha was in touch with a Universal Reality, a Cosmic Mind or Essence beyond the old Jewish idea of God as an old man with a white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere in “heaven”.
The Christian West adopted this old Jewish concept of God as “Father”, while adding Jesus Christ to the “family” of God as a personal Saviour (the “Son”), and the Holy Ghost as a dove fluttering above the heads of the Father and the Son. The Roman Catholics added the Virgin Mary to complete God’s family picture.
Religion and Spirituality
Zen is a kind of meditational life that does not depend on the authority of the scriptures or traditions, nor on churches, sects or religions. Now, this might be difficult to accept for a Westerner or a Japanese who is steeped in tradition!
Nowadays not many people understand the true function of religion. Religion is but a stepping stone to Spirituality. Religion is the observance of rites, rituals, forms and the outer trappings and casings of Spiritual Life, while Spirituality is the awakening to the Consciousness of the Soul and to the Kingdom of God within.
Whether we talk of Zen, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism or Buddhism, the basic idea has always been the same: to strive to attain to the Higher Life by prayer and meditation, to gather true Knowledge, true Insight into the Mystery of Man, and to express that Inner Knowing in Loving Service to Mankind.

￼The Jewish-Christian representation of God is appropriate for unphilosophical people who are unable to think in abstract terms. For the Buddha, however, such representations of the Universal Reality would have been grossly inferior, humanized, anthropomorphized, and contrary to his experience. Buddhism does not deny God, the Absolute Reality, but it does deny the Jewish-Christian ideas of It, because they are contrary to the experience of the Mystics who have connected with their own Soul-Natures and attained some degree of Unity with that Supreme Reality.
While Buddhists don’t believe in a personal God, a personal Saviour or a personal ego that must be “saved”, they do believe in a Universal Reality transcending all limitations, in a Universal Saviour-Principle (the Buddha-Mind) inherent in all things, and in the possibility for the human being to merge into a higher Reality, to rediscover a higher order of Truth.
This subtle point has to be understood, or sitting in Zen meditation is meaningless. In simple Western language:
God and Man are One. God and the Universe are One.
This has to be realized.
The Sanskrit word Buddha means “the Enlightened One” or “One who possesses the Awakened Mind”. Chån (meditation) is the sow- ing and Buddhahood is the reaping or the reward. A Buddha possesses Sarvaj∑a, “All-Knowledge” (Omniscience in a certain sense, pertaining to certain worlds and conditions).
There is much difference between “learning” and the Insight one gains by self-cultivation,meditation,realizingone’strueNature.Thiswasbeautifully expressed by an old Chinese Master:
Only God is alive as everyone
and everything. All beings and things and worlds are arising as spontaneous transformations or modifications of the One.
God eternally transcends the world and all the beings in it, yet the world and all beings are nothing but God.
Da Free John
￼When I was a young man I did much learning.
I read the scriptures and all their commentaries,
I was endlessly discriminating between things,
I was vainly counting the grains of sand in the ocean,
Until one day I was reprimanded by the Buddha, who asked: “What do you gain by counting other people’s gems?”

Lao Tzu
False Zen
The idea of Zen is much abused and misused by the ignorant, both in the East and in the West. Nowadays, in the West, the word Zen is used as a magic word to sell products: “Zen motorcycle maintenance”, “Zen tea-making”, Zen this and Zen that. But the average person cannot practise Zen!
False Zen A
The belief that Zen is some sort of clever intellectual twaddle, idle talk,
empty talk or nonsense.
This delusion exists in the East as well as in the West. For example:
• “What is the Buddha?” Answer: “A new bride rides a donkey, the mother-in-law leads it.”
• A disciple saw a picture of the bearded Bodhidharma and exclaimed, “Why hasn’t he a beard?”
• “Say one word with your mouth shut.”
There are many hundreds more such statements, and you may even invent a dozen yourself if you are of the “clever” type. They may engage your intellect to “find out” the answer, but this is not Zen.
Don’t engage in intellectual smartness!
You can only do Zen after your Enlightenment. For Zen is acting from the State of Unity.
This Unity occurs when your separated-self no longer exists, when only the One Self, the Åtman, is acting in you. Then you are One with the World, with all Life and all beings. But first you must attain the State of Unity which is losing your self to gain the All. Your intellect, the clever-mind, has nothing to do with it at all!
￼Everything that is a material object in this world is the Invis- ible World solidified.
An ancient esoteric saying
Matter, on this Physical Plane of Being, is but visible, solidi- fied Spirit. Primordial Matter (Aether, Åkå•a) contains within itself all that ever was, or will be, in the Three Worlds.
Living Matter 134
Zen does not involve mediumship, channelling or psychism of any kind, nor the occult arts and sciences such as astrology, tarot and numerology, nor magic or witchcraft, nor mental-control techniques. It does not depend on spirit-guides, nor on so-called ascended masters or space-beings of the Astral Plane, nor on any “spirits” outside yourself. At least you should form a clear idea of what Zen is not.
Zen, or true Mysticism (Eastern and Western), is entirely different from the channelling process. Chan- nelling is an outside interference by real or imagined etheric or astral beings who masquerade as angels, space-brothers, masters of the wisdom, and so forth. In the channelling process there is no Soul contact
either for the channel or for the listeners, only astral body contact. Zen, or Mysticism, is the development of your own consciousness within the depths of your own Soul. The knowledge you gain is intimate, deep within yourself. When you attain Soul contact, nobody uses you and you have knowledge of infinitely higher realms than what any astral or physical-etheric entity could provide.
Mediumship is not spiritual; it is psychic-material. You have to understand this, because channelling takes away the possibility of your own Soul contact. You cannot follow both paths. Psychism leads to bondage to the Astral World, whereas Zen, or any form of pure Mysticism, leads to Higher Consciousness.
Zen is not Psychism
35 The Spirit of Zen 757
￼False Zen B
The belief that things are as they appear and behind them there is
nothing.
In other words, a cow is only a cow, an event is only an event, exactly how it appears to the bodily eyes and senses, and there is nothing invisible. This delights the materialistic minds of East and West: this world is only what it appears to be, and there is nothing supernatural, nothing extraordinary; all you need to do is flow in this world without stress and with a calm mind.
Not so! Behind all that you see, hear, touch, smell or taste is the Great Invisible, and behind that is the Eternal Absolute, the Fountain Source of the Great Invisible or Supernature. Your true Nature is the One Imperishable Self, the Universal Spirit, who is Present every- where and always, radiant, full of Life and eternally Self-Conscious.
First Unite yourself with the Great Invisible, then Unite yourself with the Absolute. Then you will do Zen.
The known universe of three dimensions embraces the merest fraction of the whole Cosmos of substance and energy.

￼Materialistic thinking raises a barrier against the spiritual Life-Current
Zen and the World
When a Sage speaks, Silence blooms. When an ordinary person speaks, it merely reveals the chattering mind within.
When people hear new teachings they always try to reinterpret those teachings into their old ways of thinking and explain them away with their old-fashioned thought-patterns.
For the normal consciousness, the Original Reality, the Higher Consciousness, Tao, Nirvå≈a, seems to be a limitless Void, a sponta- neous, formless activity that eludes normal comprehension.
Materialistic thinking raises a barrier against the spiritual Life- Current.
The world is so preoccupied with money that it would take a major economic or ecological crisis for it to recognize its spiritual poverty.
No one can be made happy by force.
Do not imitate Wisdom before it becomes your Truth.
To seek for Buddha outwardly, in a form, is an error.
Men walk in their own shadows and they cry that it is dark. The future of Mankind is infinitely bright.
A disciple asked a Zen Master, “How can we attain Enlightenment? We have to dress ourselves, we have to eat, we have to work.”
And the Master said, “Well then, dress yourself, eat and work.” “But I don’t understand,” said the disciple.
And the Master replied, “If you don’t understand, then dress yourself, eat and work.”

I cannot see... therefore there is nothing to see.
I cannot hear... therefore there is nothing to hear.
I cannot feel... therefore there is nothing to touch. Such is the attitude of the spiritually-blind materialists.

Men will welcome error and crucify the Truth. And, there is nothing new under the Sun.

This group aggregate and individual ignorance of the Truth of Man are identical, like a forest and the trees, or like the sea and the waves.

Truth is like a finger pointing to the Moon. Most people look at the finger and not at the Moon.
An old Zen saying Self-knowledge cannot be imposed on a person. Under-
standing cannot be compelled.
J. Krishnamurti
Wonder of wonders! Intrinsically, all living beings are Buddha÷, endowed with wisdom and virtue. Because men’s minds have been perverted through wrong think- ing, they cannot perceive this truth.
Gautama Buddha
While a clear-mind listens to a bird singing, the stuffed- full-of-knowledge-and-cleverness-mind thinks what kind of bird is singing.
Benjamin Hoff
There is nothing to be afraid of, only to be understood.
Kung Fu
Insatiable desire for riches and pleasures; the love of fame, name and vainglory; the ignorance of Spiritual Truth; these are the worst passions of the Soul.
Our self-willed desire for many outer objects fills us with unquiet and turmoil, and we wander in the dark- ness of an unhappy life, not knowing ourselves.
For your ordinary mind is worldly and unstable; it pro- duces both good and bad thoughts; it is changeable and leans towards material things. But the God-loving mind in you will put to death all the evils which come from the ordinary mind’s careless thinking.
St Anthony the Great
I, through the labyrinth of Life can find my way,
And will not by erring lights be led astray.
I hold the key that leads me to the Core,
Peacefully I watch where others uselessly make war. On the world’s stage I play no part at all,
To vain men I, therefore, do seem so small. Even so, they see always only multiplicity, Whereas mine is the All, O what Felicity!
Lao Tzu
Those who do not know that Mind is Buddha, and attempt Enlightenment by a discipline attached to forms, follow the wrong path. There is no Buddha outside the One Mind, and there is no Mind outside the Buddha. This Mind is like Space and has no specific form. If you begin to think about it and formulate ideas about it, you ruin the reality of it and you attach your- self to forms.
Huang Po
I am Brahman [God, the Supreme Reality], without attributes, ever pure, ever free, non-dual, homogene- ous, like Space, and of the nature of Consciousness. The ignorant man identifies himself or herself with whatever he or she sees in the world. That is why Man does not know that he or she is, in fact, Brahman.

The Goal of Zen
In genuine Zen, Satori or “Enlightenment” is the experience of the seven subplanes of the Buddhic Plane and, later on, the seven subplanes of the Nirvå≈ic Plane. Thus, there are several levels of “Enlightenment” possible. In a certain sense, even the experience of the formless causal subplanes (the higher Mental Worlds) are part of this Enlightenment process.
Zen has nothing to do with the four etheric subplanes of the Physical Plane, nor the seven subplanes of the Astral Plane, nor even the four lower subplanes of the Mental Plane. This should be clear enough for you. This is why Zen is not the emotional-psychic workings, nor the mentalism (thinking) of ordinary humans.
What Zen is, is difficult to describe. It depends on your own Soul. This should be clear to you. The goal of Zen, as of all true spiritual- development schools, such as Mysticism, Yoga and S√f∆sm, is the awakening of Consciousness first on the causal subplanes, then on the Buddhic Plane and finally in Nirvå≈a, the Kingdom of God. At this stage of Cosmic Unfoldment this is the goal for Human Evolution.
In the inner worlds there are other evolutions pursuing even higher goals! And there are Divine Hierarchies who evolve on the Cosmic Planes above the Cosmic Physical Plane (beyond the seven planes of our Solar System).
Remember that the Mental Plane is divided into three subplanes with forms (with objects or shapes as we know them) and three without forms. The three lower subplanes contain forms and shapes (R√pa), whereas the higher mental subplanes are formless (Ar√pa), meaning they are states of Energy and Consciousness. The subplane in between (the fourth subplane) has both characteristics.
The Buddhic Plane is formless. The beings who dwell there are Energy- Consciousness-Bliss beings. They have a “bliss-body”, but do not think of it as a solid object. On the higher mental and Buddhic subplanes you may call yourself a “consciously-intelligently-aware disembodied entity”.
The Buddhists refer to these formless conditions of existence as °√nyatå,“emptiness, void”. °√nyatå does not mean that nothing is there; Life is there, Consciousness is there, but not with the limited forms and shapes we experience in the Three Worlds. It simply means that Life is less limited, more extended, more glorious!

￼From Matter to Light
You must remember here an esoteric fact: the gross and etheric realms of the Physical Plane, along with the Astral Plane and the Mental Plane, are the gross physical body of our Solar Logos. They are the dense body of the Cosmos. The Buddhic and Nirvå≈ic Planes, and the two planes above the Nirvå≈ic, constitute the etheric body of our Solar Logos, or the Cosmic Etheric-Physical Planes.
The etheric body of any entity is its Body of Light; thus, the four higher planes of our Solar System constitute the Light-Planes, or the Light Body (Cosmic Etheric Body) of our Solar Logos. The Cosmic Astral Planes constitute the Cosmic Astral Body of our Solar Logos, and so on. Thus, as you move into the Mystical Experience, Buddhi, Satori, in the Buddhic Realms, you move out of the Matter Worlds into the Worlds of Light.

￼Your true Mind is one with the All
The Path of Non-Duality
Zen is the Path of non-duality. The Zen Masters say:
When there is no liking and no disliking, your eyes are clear.
And...
All things move among and intermingle with each other without distinction. To realize this is to be without anxiety about your own non-perfection.
Just be part of all things, the All. The goal of Zen is to have your eyes on the Whole, the Perfect, the Complete Reality. Your true Mind is one with the All. In fact, it is the All.
Zen is characterized by the silence of the Buddha and the laughter of Lao Tzu, the two greatest exponents of Zen. The silence shows the passive side, while the laughter shows the active side. For Zen is both action and non-action, passivity and objectivity.
The root problem is your little mind, your ordinary thinking-mind, which effectively cuts you off from Mind, the Cosmic Intelligence. Your ordinary mind (Kåma-Manas, or mind tainted by passion and desire) is what you use for thinking and reasoning, for acquiring knowledge at school and university, for science and technology, for everyday life. This little mind, your personal mind, is separative, divi- sive, antagonistic, profane. Yet deep inside you there is another Mind which is like no-mind—just Pure Consciousness and Intelligence.
This real Mind is holy, whole, complete. It is Cosmic in nature, non-dual, one with all beings and all things. It may be called Buddhi-Manas, Intuitive Mind, Wisdom Mind. This Mind is infused with Love, Unity and Wisdom (Buddhi). To subjugate your ordinary rational mind (the pride of our civilization) and to awaken the Intuitive Mind, the Non-Dual Mind, is the goal of Zen and all true disciplines of Yoga, S√f∆sm and Mysticism.

The “I am” is dead! There is nothing to call “me”! There never was a “me”! It is an alle- gory, a mental image, a pattern upon which nothing was ever really modelled.
In the experience of Buddhi or Satori we transcend the personal sense of “I” and “me”, the personal sense of being separate from all that is. The experience of the Buddhic Plane is always a sense of Unity, of Oneness, and a sense of the dissolution of a personal ego, a personal “I”.

No-Mind and the One Mind
No-mind, no-thinking, or no-thought-in-the-mind (Wu-Hsin in Chinese Zen, Mu-Shin in Japanese) is the emptiness of the mind in which the One Mind can reveal Itself. It is a mind not attached to any forms or objects.
This One Mind is also described as Tat (Sanskrit: Suchness or Thatness) because it is like Space: it is Emptiness (°√nyatå), has no forms, knows no orientation or limitations; it knows neither birth nor death, neither beginning nor ending; it is neither being nor non- being; it transcends all words, thoughts or ideas about it.
The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences. When love and hate are absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised. When you make the smallest distinction, heaven and earth are set apart. If you wish to know the Truth, hold no opinions, for or against. The struggle of what you like and what you do not like is a disease of your mind.
The Chinese Master Sosan
The No-mind of the Zen Masters is not a mindlessness. It is not a zombie-like condition or unintelligence. It is simply the transcending of your ordinary mind, the Kåma-Manas, the desire-filled mind, the judgmental, critical, rational mind. It is the stopping of the endless chattering, criticizing commentary of your ordinary mind and the awakening into a silent, non-judgmental, holistic, super-rational Mind: first the formless Causal Mind on the causal subplanes, then the Buddhi-Mind (Wisdom-Mind) on the Buddhic Plane and finally the Supreme Intelligence on the Åtmic or Nirvå≈ic Plane.
Go on renouncing thinking, and act as if nothing has ever happened.
To experience Zen you must renounce “thinking about things” but not “doing things”. You must remain dynamically active, but this activity must not be tied up with your ego-sense. It must be purely a spontaneous activity of Consciousness, without any egotistical striving. You must have spontaneous-action-awareness.
Those who have “renounced” the world—the sådhu÷, sannyåsin÷, wander- ing ascetics, monks and nuns—have, in effect, merely renounced action, but spend their time thinking, contemplating or meditating. This is not the right human condition.
To Become a True Renunciate 257
My original Self-Nature is primarily pure. When my true Mind is known, and my Original Essence is seen, I naturally attain the Path of Buddhahood.

If you have dust on your inner-eye, the Universe appears to be limited. But, with nothing in your mind, the Universe is endless.

￼The true Mind does not act in any way. It neither comes nor goes, is not born and does not die. It does not move but remains motionless.
Hsu Yun
This One Mind is not the ordinary mind of conceptual reasoning thought, and it is detached from all form- structures. In this way, the Buddha÷ and sentient beings are not different at all. If you can rid yourself of all ordinary, conceptual thinking processes, you will have accomplished your goal. But if you do not get rid of the faculty of thinking, in a flash, even though you strive for aeon after aeon, you will never accomplish Enlightenment.
A single Spiritual-Brilliance is this One Mind. The terms “Unity” and “Oneness” refer to this homogeneous Spiritual-Brilliance. The transmission of this Form- less-Mind (the Void) cannot be made through words. A transmission with concrete thoughts cannot be the eternal Dharma (Truth). The transmitting of this One Mind, and the receiving of the transmission, are a dif- ficult and mysterious undertaking, and few have ever been able to receive it. This transmission of the Mind and its reception is Zen.
Huang Po
The Enlightened Beings (Buddha÷) and the ordinary people are both in the One Mind. This One Mind is like Space whose boundaries know no measure. You cannot apply any concepts to the One Mind. This One Mind is the Buddha-Nature. As soon as your thinking ceases, and you stop forming ideas in your mind, the Buddha- Nature reveals itself to you.
Huang Po
In this One Mind, there is not any particular shape or form that you can lay your hands on [meditate upon].
Huang Po
Nothing, save the Universal Mind, is conceivable. Mind, in its uninhibited nature, brings forth all that comes into existence. That which manifests is like a wave upon the Ocean of Mind. This state of Mind, which is above duali- ties, brings Liberation. This Mind is beyond Nature, but it expresses itself in Nature’s forms. The realization of this One Mind brings Salvation from rebirth. All beings are of this Buddha-Essence, but they have to realize this before they can enter Nirvå≈a.
The Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation
It should be thoroughly understood that all men have One Mind, One God and Father, One Life, Truth and Love.... Intelligence is the primal and eternal quality of Infinite Mind, of the Triune Principle—Life, Truth and Love—named God. Mind is God. God is the only Mind.
Mary Baker Eddy
Mrs Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, experienced the state of Zen or Mystical Consciousness. Her description is the experience of the Buddhic Plane. She perceived God as the One Mind. Interestingly, this is also how the Tibetan, Chinese, Hindu and Japanese Mystics independently describe the Higher Reality.
The Vedic Yog∆÷ of India described Parabrahman (the One Transcendental Reality, or “God”) from their experience as Satcidånanda (Sat-Cit- Ånanda: Beingness or Life, Consciousness or Mind, and Happiness or Bliss)!
Mary Baker Eddy wrote about her experience more than a hundred years ago, when there were no books on Zen translated from the Chinese or Japanese. The West did not know of Zen, yet her description is Zen, as you shall see! The revelation within her Soul she called Christian Science.
Christian Mysticism and Zen 630
Messengers of the One Mind
￼￼
A mind which is not dispersed amongst external things of the senses returns to itself, and from itself it ascends to God by an unerring Path.
Saint Basil the Great
Blessed is the man whose help is from the Lord, who ascends by prayer—not of words, but of the Heart.
An old Christian mystical saying
Blessed is he whom Truth itself teaches, not by words or symbols, but as it is, in itself.
Thomas à Kempis: The Imitation of Christ
Practice forgiveness by letting go of all resentments and all sense of retribution. This is the Way of Love.
Christian Mysticism
The beginning of the Path is where the personality keeps silent and the Soul lives. The beginning of the Path is where the personality abstains from actions, where you can say, “Do you, oh God, take the lead!”
The ancient Rose and the Cross
I and my Father are One. All that the Father is, I am. All that the Father has, is mine.
Jesus the Christ
This is true of all of us. It needs to be realized.
It is the old tradition of the Christian Russian Ortho- dox Church to awaken the spiritual qualities of the Soul which are to be found in each individual. The task of the Church, its prophetic mission, is to divinize Man, to light another’s candle on the altar of Spiritual Rebirth.
The Metropolitan Bishop of Volokolamsk
Would that the Church, in both East and West, really understand her mission!
Father, honour me with the Glory that I had with you before the world was made.
An ancient Eastern Christian prayer
And here are some early Christian Mystics of the Eastern Orthodox Church:
The divine and deifying Illumination of Grace is not the essence of God, but is the energy of God.
Saint Gregory of Palamas
Illumination is the wonder of the total uplifting of the powers of the Soul towards the Majesty and Glory of God. It is the outreaching of the mind towards the Limitless Power of the Light. Ecstasy is the taking up of the faculties of the Soul to heavenly states, and the removal of the Soul from the actions of the physical senses.... The Love experienced in the Heart is for those who are still in the process of Enlightenment, but Ecstatic Love is for those who are perfect in Spiritual Love. Both work on the mind and draw it away from the physical senses.
Saint Gregory of Sinai
It is by His Light energies that we can say that we can know God.
Saint Basil
According to the Fa Yen Chinese Zen School: The Three Worlds are but the One Mind. And...
All things are but Consciousness.
The “Three Worlds” refers to the Physical, Astral and Mental Planes.

Enlightenment
When a Chinese Zen Master was asked to describe Zen, he said:
The sword has gone long ago.
This means perfect peace of mind. Here there is no aggression, no comparisons, no criticisms, no disquiet. This is “the peace that passes all understanding” spoken of by Saint Paul (Philippians 4:7).
There is a Zen saying:
Body asleep, mind awake.
This is the condition that leads to the experience of Satori or “Enlightenment”.TheaimofChån(Zen,Dhyån)istoemptyyour mind of all phenomena so that your Self-Nature can return to its “normal” condition. This means that when you clear your mind of all impressions of worldly objects, inner images, and thoughts, you discover your Self-Nature, as you really are, as a Soul, a Spirit, a Being above your personality level, a Being which is eternal, timeless and immortal. This is Enlightenment.
t
SaΩsåra is disturbance, the phenomenal life in the Three Worlds. °√nyatå, the Void, is Stillness and Peace.
Nirvå≈a is the condition in which both Creation and Emptiness vanish.
Terms of Awakening
Awakening is called Bodhi in Sanskrit, Wu or Lung-Tan in Chinese, and Satori in Japanese Zen traditions. A modern term for it is Enlight- enment. It is a mass of Brightness and a resurgence of the sense of the Real within you.
Wu also means “Not-Doing”, and Wu-Wei means “the Not-Doing of the Eternal”, or Transcendental Inactivity.
Wu (Chinese) is Mu in Japanese. That is why, in some old Japanese monas- teries, you hear the monks bellowing “Mu!” (“Not this, not this!”).

The Thought of Enlightenment
The whole Universe, including Man, is an embodied thought. Man also has the ability to create forms for the clothing of his ideas in tangible matter... That which we see and touch with our physical senses is but an effect of subtle, inner, underlying causes [the psychic dimensions]. Even these causes are only those causes which underlie the grossly objective physical plane; he will not really have ascertained the vital impulse coming from Being, as yet, the Cause of causes.
Master DK
We go through this endless cycle of births and deaths (SaΩsåra) because of our ignorance of the source of this cycle of births and deaths, and because of our forgetfulness of the Mind-Essence (Nirvå≈a) in the midst of this Cause-and-Effect Nexus (Karma) which governs these worlds of forms.
°√rangama S√tra
Good karma÷ come, and evil karma÷ too, but both are illusions. Your body is like a foam or a bubble, and like air is your mind. This Måyå has no substance and no reality.
Shikhin Buddha (The 999th Buddha of the Golden Age)
Very few people understand the power of thought, that each thought they think is a cause which will make something happen. Thoughts are causal, they lead to effects. Every thought acts as a cause of some effect. This is the Law of Karma in action on the mind level. Thus, the thought of Enlightenment will act as a cause, a seed, which in time will flourish into the effect, the realization. Hence the importance of meditation or Zen.
The Law of Karma brings about reincarnation, for we return again and again to repay our debts. When you become free of debts, you will be a Free Man.
Your highest Self-Nature is your Being in Nirvå≈a. That is called Reality. From such a viewpoint, your ordinary mind and body are called illusion or Måyå.
Concerning the freedom of the Spirit, note this well: the Spirit is free so long as it is not attached to nameable things.
Meister Eckhart
The thought of Enlightenment will flourish into the effect, the realization

Chung Feng
The Self-Mind is the term used by the Zen people for your Consciousness, for the root of your mind, before thoughts have arisen in it. When you realize this, then you are in the true state of meditation, which is called Chån, Zen or Dhyån. In Korean Mysticism it is Zøn, and in Tibetan it is Bøn.

￼When the mind is free of thoughts and passions, then Truth flowers on its own
When the Mind is Still
The birds sing, the flowers smile and the moon reaches down to the stream.
Master Hsu Yun
That is, when the mind is still, free of thoughts and passions, then Truth flowers on its own.
The mind is the great slayer of the Real. Let the disciple slay the slayer.
H.P. Blavatsky
The mundane activities of the mind must be quietened and stilled; then one’s Self-Nature becomes manifest. This Self-Nature is the Buddha- Mind—Samådhi, Zen, Satori, Bodhi. This is Praj∑åparamitå, “Transcendental Wisdom”. This is “the Christ in you, your hope of Glory”, as expressed by Saint Paul (Colossians 1:27).
Fundamentally, there is no day or night, only the Brightness.
When the ordinary mind (the lower mind, the mental body) is qui- etened of its activity of endlessly producing thoughts, then the Higher Mind (the Causal Mind in the causal body) will manifest. By a further movement inward you awaken to the plane of Buddhi, the Wisdom- Mind (Bodhi). Then, one plane above the Buddhic Plane of Being is Mahåpraj∑åparamitå, “Great-Wisdom-Transcendental”, Nirvå≈ic Consciousness, the Mind of Light.

There are those who find true peace and quiet and strength and renewal when they are alone with themselves. These are those who keep company with Divinity.
Annalee Skarin
This being alone with yourself is what Zen or Mysticism is about. This is what the Christian Mystics called “the flight of the alone to the alone”. This is not the same as loneliness, boredom, depression or suicidal ten- dencies, for you “dwell with Divinity”. There is no outside interference in this process; it is between your own Soul and God.
Alone with God 700
The Great Wisdom of the Other Shore
Mahå-Praj∑å-Paramitå
The Great Wisdom of the Other Shore reached.
Mahå: great.
Praj∑å: the Wisdom of seeing into one’s Self-Nature. Paramitå: Transcendental Virtue and Knowledge.
The Mystic, having attained to “the Great Wisdom of the Other Shore reached”, Nirvå≈a, realizes the Original-Mind of the Universe. This Self-Nature contains within itself all the universes, all the stars and galaxies, all the worlds, all the angels and human beings, all heavens and hells.
Praj∑å is eternally abiding, and is your own Self-Nature. He who has experienced this is free from obstructing thoughts, from past memories and worldly attachments. This is what is called Thatness or Suchness, because it is indescribable. When all things are experienced in the Light of Wisdom, Praj∑å, then there is neither attachment nor non-attachment to the worlds of objects. This is seeing into your Fundamental Nature or Buddha-Mind. This way you become a Buddha.
Hui Neng
When you cling to the objective world (the Physical, Astral and Mental Planes) there is birth and death for you. When you cling to Praj∑å (the Transcendental Wisdom of the Buddhic and Nirvå≈ic Planes), there is no birth and no death.
The Christ in you, your hope of Glory, spoken of by Saint Paul in the New Testament, is the same as your Buddha-Nature, your Buddha-Mind, your Self-Nature, the Original Mind of the Zen Masters, and the Self, or Åtman, of the Yog∆÷ of old.
It is as if there were two of you: the you as you know yourself on the personality level and the You that needs to be discovered, the Eternal and Timeless Spirit that you are.

￼The Enlightenment of Teh Shan
￼￼Once upon a time, in the northern part of China, there was a man called Chou. He became a Buddhist monk and for many years he studied the holy books of Buddhism, the S√tra÷ and the °åstra÷, until he became a well known and greatly respected pundit.
One day he learned that there was a Zen sect in the southern part of China, so he decided to travel there and teach them “a thing or two”, for he thought the Zen people were foolish. So he left his monastery and began his long journey on foot, carrying on his shoulders a scripture, “The com- mentary by Tao Yin on the Diamond S√tra” (which was very heavy, since in those days it was written on blocks of wood). After a long journey on foot, carrying the heavy book on his shoulders each day, he arrived at the province where the famous Zen monastery was located.
As he walked along the road he came to a stall where an old woman was selling pastry, like cakes, which in Chinese were called Tien-Hsin or “mind- refresheners”. So, he put down his heavy book and decided to buy a Tien-Hsin. And the old lady asked, “What heavy burden are you carrying, O monk?”
“I am carrying a commentary on a scripture,” replied the monk.
“Which scripture?” asked the woman.
“Tao Yin’s commentary on the Diamond S√tra,” said the monk.
Then the old women said to the monk,“I’ll tell you what, monk; I will give you a mind-refreshener if you will answer me this question:‘Since a past or a present or a future mind cannot be found, what are you going to refresh?’”
The monk became speechless. He was dumbfound- ed. He left the old woman in a hurry.
After many more days of journey on foot, carry- ing his heavy burden, the monk arrived at the Zen monastery, the name of which was Lung-Tan, “The Dragon’s Lake”. Since he wanted to show off what a great man he was, as he entered the meditation hall he said, “For many years I wanted to see this famous Dragon’s Lake; now that I am here, I see not a dragon and not a lake.”
Upon hearing this, the Zen Master of the monas- tery replied, “But even so, you have arrived at the Dragon’s Lake.”
Again the learned monk became confused and speechless. For the Dragon is the Wisdom and the Lake is the Mind, and the Zen Teacher’s function is to stir the Mind of the disciple so that he too may become a Dragon of Wisdom—a Buddha.
The monk was not yet ready for Enlightenment, but he decided to stay at the monastery anyway. One day he was attending upon the Teacher of the monastery. It was getting very late at night and the Master said to him, “Why don’t you retire now to your room?” So the monk said good night to his Teacher and went out.
Then immediately he came back in and said, “But Master, it is very dark outside.” The Master lit a lamp and gave it to the monk. As the monk was about to pass through the door, the Master blew out the lamp. At that moment, for the third time in his life, the monk became speechless—and, this time, Enlightened. For we all carry our own Light within us.
This monk became the famous Zen Master Teh Shan. This is how things were in the olden days. w
